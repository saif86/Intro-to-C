# Intro-to-C
## My first semester of graduation project with baby programming skills

1.	Draw a car for which the size will be given by user. You have to draw the car using only the putpixel( ) function.

2.	Implement a small dictionary using files. Take a word as input from user and print its meaning if the word is in the dictionary.

3.	Matrix Operation
  *	Addition
  *	Subtraction
  *	Multiplication
  *	Determinant
  *	Inverse

4.	Convert the numbers to and from the following formats:
*	Binary
*	Decimal
*	Octal
*	Hexadecimal
User can give input in any format, convert the input to all of the other formats and display them.

5.	GPA Calculator:-
Take the following inputs from user:
*	name
*	registration #
*	number of subjects
*	marks obtained in each subject
*	name of all subjects
*	credit hours of all subjects
Take these inputs for 5 users and calculate their GPA and display all the information on the screen.
NOTE:-	number of subjects, name of all subjects & credit hours of all subjects will be same for all the students. So you will need to input these values for only once. Use structures, arrays & strings to write the code.

6.	Simple Calculator:-
Make a simple calculator which is capable to perform following functions.
*	Addition, subtraction, division, multiplication
*	sin, cos, tan
*	Square root, square, x power y(where x is the number and y is its power). You are not allowed to use built-in functions for square root, square, x power y.

7.	Read a passage from file and perform the following functions:
*	Convert all characters to lower/upper case
*	Convert the 1st character of the word to lower/upper case.
*	If after a full stop or comma, no space is provided(which is a error), then correct this error.
You are allowed to use any built-in function.

8.	Draw a Bar graph and line graph of the specification entered by user. All the drawing must be done by using putpixel( ) function.

9.	Watch

10.	Take a number from user whose range is from 0 â€“ 999. Display this number in words.
